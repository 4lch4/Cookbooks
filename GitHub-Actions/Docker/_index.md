# Docker GitHub Actions

This directory is home to my cookbooks on building, publishing, and managing Docker images using GitHub Actions. From things such as a simple workflow to build & push the latest image to a more complex workflow that builds & pushes the latest multi-architecture/platform image, tags the image with the current date, and pushes that image to DockerHub and GitHub Container Registry.

The more advanced example is to come, but the Simple one is being added first (./Simple.md).
