# Cookbooks

A collection of "cookbooks", guides, templates, scripts, etc., that serve a variety of different purposes. The only unifying property/theme amongst them all is their ease of use and "guaranteed" quality.

I say this lightly because I'm not perfect and I'm sure there are some mistakes in here somewhere. If you find any, please let me know by opening an issue and/or submitting a pull request.
